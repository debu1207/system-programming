lseek - reposition read/write file offset

#include <sys/types.h>
#include <unistd.h>

off_t lseek(int fd, off_t offset, int whence);

Description:
lseek() repositions the file offset of the open file description associated with the file descriptor fd to the argument offset according to the directive whence as follows:

SEEK_SET: The file offset is set to offset bytes.

SEEK_CUR: The file offset is set to its current location plus offset bytes.

SEEK_END: The file offset is set to the size of the file plus offset bytes.

      lseek() allows the file offset to be set beyond the end of the file (but this does not change the size of the file).  If data is later written at this point, subsequent reads of the data in the
      gap (a "hole") return null bytes ('\0') until data is actually written into the gap.

Return value:
Upon  successful  completion,  lseek() returns the resulting offset location as measured in bytes from the beginning of the file.  On error, the value (off_t) -1 is returned and errno is set to
indicate the error.
